  download_dir           = "/data/incomplete"
  download_free          = "10G"
  complete_dir           = "/data/complete"
  complete_free          = "20G"
  auto_resume            = true
  permissions            = "755"
  watched_dir            = "/data/nzb-watch"
  watched_dir_scan_speed = 5
  scripts_dir            = "/config/scripts"
  password_file          = "/config/passwords.txt"
  nzb_backup_dir         = "/data/nzb-backup"

- `scripts_dir` (String) Folder where user scripts (post-processing and pre-queue) are stored.
- `watched_dir` (String) Folder periodically scanned for new NZB files. Supports category sub-folders and filename prefixes for automatic categorization.
- `watched_dir_scan_speed` (Number) Seconds between filesystem scans of watched folder. Set to 0 to disable automatic scans.
